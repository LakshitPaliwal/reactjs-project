By default import :-
import CookieConsent from "react-cookie-consent";

if we want to add or remove  then we have to use  this:-
//import CookieConsent, { Cookies } from "react-cookie-consent";


for deploying we uses this tag :-
<CookieConsent>
    This website uses cookies to enhance the user experience.
</CookieConsent>


You can optionally set some props like this (next chapter will show all props):

<CookieConsent
    location="bottom"
    buttonText="Sure man!!"
    cookieName="myAwesomeCookieName2"
    style={{ background: "#2B373B" }}
    buttonStyle={{ color: "#4e503b", fontSize: "13px" }}
    expires={150}
>
    This website uses cookies to enhance the user experience.{" "}
    <span style={{ fontSize: "10px" }}>
    This bit of text is smaller :O
    </span>
</CookieConsent>



 after popup appears when we scroll the webpage then it by deafult cick on YES and  automatically disappears
 we don't need to click on Cookies Consent Popup
 for this finctionality we will use this :-
 
<CookieConsent
    acceptOnScroll={true}
    onAccept={({ acceptedByScrolling }) => {
        if (acceptedByScrolling) {
            // triggered if user scrolls past threshold
            alert("Accept was triggered by user scrolling");
        } else {
            alert("Accept was triggered by clicking the Accept button");
        }
    }}
>
 
</CookieConsent>


if we wants alert after clicking on Cookie Consent Popup
then we wil use this  :-

<CookieConsent
    enableDeclineButton
    onDecline={() => {alert("nay!")}}
>
 
</CookieConsent>
